> my end game keyboard... I hope

**Beware: I haven't built this yet. So I guess it might not work**

## What is this thing?
I've been using an ErgoDox as my only keyboard for quite a few years now and I
love it. I may have a need for a more portable keyboard in the future so I've
been exploring keyboards with less keys. There are so many candidates but none
match *exactly* what I want, so why not build my own!

I know the sticking out thumb cluster affects portability a bit but I'm totally
willing to make that tradeoff for a more useful keyboard.

As this will be the first board I've built from scratch, I'll try to piggy back
on existing an QMK keyboard that already has a strong community; I'm thinking
the ergotravel.

## Repo layout
The `master.dxf` file is the source of truth for the switch plate. It contains
both the top and bottom plates (the bottom is a subset of the top). The
`derived-cad` directory contains files that have been *derived* from the
master, as a convenience. And so multiple people don't have to repeat the same
work.

Some CAD cutters want you to put your designs in context of a sheet of their
material so I'm also storing these files as I gather quotes.

## Desgin choices:
  - ErgoDox style ortho-columnar
  - Make all thumb keys easily accessible from the normal hand position
  - keep my vim-style arrows on the right hand
  - same plate design for both halves, achieved with optional switches
  - optional switch holes aren't completely cut, so you don't have an unsightly
      hole in the position you don't use. To break the piece out, stick
      something through the circular hole and twist it out.
  - leverage QMK layout from an existing keyboard if possible. Any 4x7 layout
      is a contender: ergotravel, Ergo42, Runner3680
  - layer status LEDs
  - those large, pink keys are placeholders for the pro micros
  - the thumb keys are rotated the opposite way to what you'd think because
    they pack tighter (make a smaller footprint) and still feel ok
  - minimise overall footprint by using internal standoffs (thanks for the idea
      ergotravel)
  - mounting holes for a SwanMatch Moge Naide Pro Micro socket [photo

      so you can either plug directly into your Pro Micro, or mount it reverse
      and wire it to a USB breakout board. This way you can run USB-C via a
      breakout board even if your Pro Micro doesn't support it. Plus, if you
      break a connector, it's only the breakout board.
  - mounting holes for the [SparkFun USB-C breakout
      board](https://github.com/sparkfun/USB-C-Breakout/)
  - use only 1U key caps to minimise size and because stabilisers are annoying

## The switch plate

## Open questions
  1. do we need [pull up
     resistors](https://beta.docs.qmk.fm/features/feature_split_keyboard#required-hardware) for communication between the two halves?
  1. what length standoffs/screws do we need between the top and bottom?
  1. what length standoffs/screws do we need between the Pro Micro sockets and the
     top/bottom?

## FAQ
**Is there a PCB?**\
Not yet. I haven't yet learned how to design PCBs yet (still learning the CAD
for the switch plate). Once I've tried the layout with a handwired prototype, I
might tackle the PCB.

**Do you have keyboard-layout-editor source?**\
Yes. Either [this file](./keyboard-layout-editor-config.txt) in this repo or here's a (hopefully up to date)

Note that those big pink keys in the middle are placeholders for Pro Micros.
Don't cut a switch hole there.
