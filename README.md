> my end game keyboard... I hope

**Beware: I haven't built this yet. So I guess it might not work**

## What is this thing?
I've been using an ErgoDox as my only keyboard for quite a few years now and I
love it. I may have a need for a more portable keyboard in the future so I've
been exploring keyboards with less keys. There are so many candidates
([here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19-rTWbp8SCKdZFByPZu3RT8NSF8vVddDe8WL6R6b1qQ/edit?usp=sharing),
[here](https://keebfol.io/), [here](https://golem.hu/boards/) and
[here](https://github.com/diimdeep/awesome-split-keyboards)) but none match
*exactly* what I want, so why not build my own!

I know the sticking out thumb cluster affects portability a bit but I'm totally
willing to make that tradeoff for a more useful keyboard.

As this will be the first board I've built from scratch, I'll try to piggy back
on existing an QMK keyboard that already has a strong community; I'm thinking
the ErgoTravel.

## Repo layout
The `master.dxf` file is the source of truth for the switch plate. It contains
both the top and bottom plates (the bottom is a subset of the top). The
`derived-cad` directory contains files that have been *derived* from the
master, as a convenience. And so multiple people don't have to repeat the same
work.

Some CAD cutters want you to put your designs in context of a sheet of their
material so I'm also storing these files as I gather quotes.

## Desgin choices:
  - ErgoDox style ortho-columnar
  - Make all thumb keys easily accessible from the normal hand position
  - keep my vim-style arrows on the right hand, and directly below the home row
  - same plate design for both halves
  - leverage QMK layout from an existing keyboard if possible. Any 4x6 or 4x7 layout
      is a contender:
      [ErgoTravel](https://github.com/jpconstantineau/ErgoTravel),
      [Ergo42](https://github.com/Biacco42/Ergo42),
      [Runner3680](https://github.com/omkbd/Runner3680)
  - layer status LEDs
  - those large, pink keys are placeholders for the pro micros
  - the thumb keys are rotated the opposite way to what you'd think because
    they pack tighter (make a smaller footprint) and still feel ok
  - minimise overall footprint by using internal standoffs (thanks for the idea
      ErgoTravel)
  - mounting holes for a SwanMatch Moge Naide [Pro Micro socket](#pro-micro-socket)
      in either orientation.  So you can either plug directly into your Pro
      Micro, or mount it reverse and wire it to a USB breakout board. This way
      you can run USB-C via a breakout board even if your Pro Micro doesn't
      support it. Plus, if you break a connector, it's only the breakout board.
  - mounting holes for the [SparkFun USB-C breakout
      board](https://github.com/sparkfun/USB-C-Breakout/)
  - use only 1U key caps to minimise size and because stabilisers are annoying

## Parts list
  - 2x top plates
  - 2x bottom plates
  - 2x pro micros
  - 2x [pro micro sockets](#pro-micro-socket)
  - 2x TRRS connectors
  - 1x TRRS cable
  - 2x reset switches
  - 50x key switches
  - 50x 1U key caps
  - 50x 1N4148 diodes
  - 2x 4.7kÎ© pull-up resistors
  - 6x 3mm LEDs, for layer status
  - 18x 7mm hex M2 standoffs (11 per side), for between top and bottom plates
  - 36x 4mm M2 screws (18 per side)
  - 8x 3mm M2 standoffs (4 per side), for mounting the Pro Micro sockets
  - 16x 2mm M2 screws (8 per side)
  - (optional) 2x SparkFun USB-C breakout boards
  - (optional) 2x USB micro cables to wire the Pro Micro to the breakout board

## Open questions
  1. do we need [pull up
     resistors](https://beta.docs.qmk.fm/features/feature_split_keyboard#required-hardware) for communication between the two halves?
  1. what length standoffs/screws do we need between the top and bottom?
  1. what length standoffs/screws do we need between the Pro Micro sockets and the
     top/bottom?
  1. will layer status LEDs clear keycaps
  1. can we have no top plate over the pro micro to keep the whole board
     thinner, like the crkbd?
  1. if I fork the crkbd, can we use the backlight LEDs as layer status
     indicators? Or do we still need to add layer LEDs separately?

## Answered questions
  1. can I get the same "only flash master" behaviour as the Ergodox EZ by
     using a [MCP23018-E/SP I/O expander](https://www.ergodox.io/#electronics)
     on the slave side? Yes, but it's not worth it as it'll be slow.

## Pro Micro socket
I'll be using [these](./misc/swanmatch-moge-naide.jpg) Pro Micro sockets.
They're labelled with SwanMatch and Moge Naide. SwanMatch is a
[person](https://github.com/swanmatch) but I'm unsure what Moge Naide means.
I'm guessing it's the name of the PCB?  I can't find a GitHub repo for the PCB,
but here's some mentions of it around the internet:

## FAQ
**Do you have keyboard-layout-editor source?**\
Yes. Either [this file](./layout.kle) in this repo or here's a (hopefully up to date)
