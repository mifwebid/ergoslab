> my end game keyboard... I hope

**Beware: I haven't built this yet. So I guess it might not work**

## What is this thing?
I've been using an ErgoDox as my only keyboard for quite a few years now and I
love it. I may have a need for a more portable keyboard in the future so I've
been exploring keyboards with less keys. There are so many candidates
([here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19-rTWbp8SCKdZFByPZu3RT8NSF8vVddDe8WL6R6b1qQ/edit?usp=sharing), [here](https://keebfol.io/)
and [here](https://github.com/diimdeep/awesome-split-keyboards)) but none match
*exactly* what I want, so why not build my own!

I know the sticking out thumb cluster affects portability a bit but I'm totally
willing to make that tradeoff for a more useful keyboard.

As this will be the first board I've built from scratch, I'll try to piggy back
on existing an QMK keyboard that already has a strong community; I'm thinking
the ErgoTravel.

## Repo layout
The `master.dxf` file is the source of truth for the switch plate. It contains
both the top and bottom plates (the bottom is a subset of the top). The
`derived-cad` directory contains files that have been *derived* from the
master, as a convenience. And so multiple people don't have to repeat the same
work.

Some CAD cutters want you to put your designs in context of a sheet of their
material so I'm also storing these files as I gather quotes.

## Desgin choices:
  - ErgoDox style ortho-columnar
  - Make all thumb keys easily accessible from the normal hand position
  - keep my vim-style arrows on the right hand, and directly below the home row
  - same plate design for both halves
  - leverage QMK layout from an existing keyboard if possible. Any 4x6 or 4x7 layout
      is a contender:
      [ErgoTravel](https://github.com/jpconstantineau/ErgoTravel),
      [Ergo42](https://github.com/Biacco42/Ergo42),
      [Runner3680](https://github.com/omkbd/Runner3680)
  - layer status LEDs
  - those large, pink keys are placeholders for the pro micros
  - the thumb keys are rotated the opposite way to what you'd think because
    they pack tighter (make a smaller footprint) and still feel ok
  - minimise overall footprint by using internal standoffs (thanks for the idea
      ErgoTravel)
  - mounting holes for a SwanMatch Moge Naide [Pro Micro socket](#pro-micro-socket)
      in either orientation.  So you can either plug directly into your Pro
      Micro, or mount it reverse and wire it to a USB breakout board. This way
      you can run USB-C via a breakout board even if your Pro Micro doesn't
      support it. Plus, if you break a connector, it's only the breakout board.
  - mounting holes for the [SparkFun USB-C breakout
      board](https://github.com/sparkfun/USB-C-Breakout/)
  - use only 1U key caps to minimise size and because stabilisers are annoying

## The switch plate
![switch plate](./switch-plate.png)

## Open questions
  1. do we need [pull up
     resistors](https://beta.docs.qmk.fm/features/feature_split_keyboard#required-hardware) for communication between the two halves?
  1. what length standoffs/screws do we need between the top and bottom?
  1. what length standoffs/screws do we need between the Pro Micro sockets and the
     top/bottom?
  1. how do we get flash behaviour the same as the Ergodox EZ: only need to
     flash master
  1. will layer status LEDs clear keycaps
  1. can we have no top plate over the pro micro to keep the whole board
     thinner, like the crkbd?
  1. can I get the same "only flash master" behaviour as the Ergodox EZ by
     using a [MCP23018-E/SP I/O expander](https://www.ergodox.io/#electronics)
     on the slave side?

## Pro Micro socket
I'll be using [these](./misc/swanmatch-moge-naide.jpg) Pro Micro sockets.
They're labelled with SwanMatch and Moge Naide. SwanMatch is a
[person](https://github.com/swanmatch) but I'm unsure what Moge Naide means.
I'm guessing it's the name of the PCB?  I can't find a GitHub repo for the PCB,
but here's some mentions of it around the internet:

## FAQ
**Is there a PCB?**\
Not yet. I haven't yet learned how to design PCBs yet (still learning the CAD
for the switch plate). Once I've tried the layout with a handwired prototype, I
might tackle the PCB.

**Do you have keyboard-layout-editor source?**\
Yes. Either [this file](./keyboard-layout-editor-config.txt) in this repo or here's a (hopefully up to date)
[permalink](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/##@@_y:1&x:3;&=E&_x:8.75;&=I;&@_y:-0.875&x:2;&=W&_x:1;&=R&_x:6.75;&=U&_x:1;&=O;&@_y:-0.875&x:5;&=T&_c=#ffebeb&g:true&a:7&w:1.25&h:3;&=&_x:2.25&w:1.25&h:3;&=&_c=#cccccc&g:false&a:4;&=Y;&@_y:-0.875;&=%7C%0A%5C&=Q&_x:12.75;&=P&_a:7;&=;&@_y:-0.375&x:3&a:4;&=D&_x:8.75;&=K;&@_y:-0.875&x:2;&=S&_x:1;&=F&_x:6.75;&=J&_x:1;&=L;&@_y:-0.875&x:5;&=G&_x:4.75;&=H;&@_y:-0.875;&=Tab&=A&_x:12.75;&=/:%0A/;&=%22%0A';&@_y:-0.375&x:3;&=C&_x:8.75;&=%3C%0A,;&@_y:-0.875&x:2;&=X&_x:1;&=V&_x:6.75;&=M&_x:1;&=%3E%0A.;&@_y:-0.875&x:5;&=B&_x:4.75;&=N;&@_y:-0.875;&=Shift&=Z&_x:12.75;&=?%0A//&=Shift;&@_y:-0.375&x:3;&=Del&_x:8.75&a:7;&=%E2%86%93;&@_y:-0.875&x:2&a:4;&=Alt&_x:1;&=L2&_x:6.75&a:7;&=%E2%86%90&_x:1;&=%E2%86%91;&@_y:-0.75&a:4;&=Ctrl&_a:7;&=&_x:12.75;&=%E2%86%92&=;&@_r:10&rx:12&ry:4.5&x:-1.25&a:4;&=Space;&@_y:-0.75&x:-2.25&a:7;&=;&@_x:-2.25&a:4;&=Enter;&@_r:-10&rx:4.75&x:0.25;&=Bksp;&@_y:-0.75&x:1.25&a:7;&=;&@_x:1.25&a:4;&=L1%0AEsc).
Note that those big pink keys in the middle are placeholders for Pro Micros.
Don't cut a switch hole there.
