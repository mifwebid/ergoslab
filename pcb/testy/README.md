# What is this?
I'm learning about PCB design, so I can make my own mechanical keyboard. This
is a "hello world" project to test my ideas/goals.

# Goals
- Support for Kailh hotswap sockets
- One PCB design that works as all 3 layers of a sandwich design: base, PCB and
    switch plate. Idea taken from [for-split-keyboard](https://github.com/peej/for-split-keyboard)
- a design that can be used for either side of a split keyboard
- support 5 pin switches
- single socket for ProMicro. Just mount it flipped for other side
